# Sigma-Test

We would like to have a RESTful API for our statistics. The main use case for the API is to calculate realtime statistics for the last 60 seconds of transactions.

The API needs the following endpoints:

∙ POST /transactions – called every time a transaction is made.

∙ GET /statistics – returns the statistic based of the transactions of the last 60 seconds.

∙ DELETE /transactions – deletes all transactions.

 

Specs

POST /transactions

This endpoint is called to create a new transaction. It MUST execute in constant time and memory (O(1)).

Body:

{

  "amount": "12.3343",

  "timestamp": "2018-07-17T09:59:51.312Z"

}

Where:

∙ amount – transaction amount; a string of arbitrary length that is parsable as a BigDecimal

∙ timestamp – transaction time in the ISO 8601 format YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.sssZ in the UTC timezone (this is not the current timestamp)

 

Returns: Empty body with one of the following:

∙ 201 – in case of success

∙ 204 – if the transaction is older than 60 seconds

∙ 400 – if the JSON is invalid

∙ 422 – if any of the fields are not parsable or the transaction date is in the future

 

GET /statistics

This endpoint returns the statistics based on the transactions that happened in the last 60 seconds. It MUST execute in constant time and memory (O(1)).

Returns:

{

  "sum": "1000.00",

  "avg": "100.53",

  "max": "200000.49",

  "min": "50.23",

  "count": 10

}

 

Where:

∙ sum – a BigDecimal specifying the total sum of transaction value in the last 60 seconds

∙ avg – a BigDecimal specifying the average amount of transaction value in the last 60 seconds

∙ max – a BigDecimal specifying single highest transaction value in the last 60 seconds

∙ min – a BigDecimal specifying single lowest transaction value in the last 60 seconds

∙ count – a long specifying the total number of transactions that happened in the last 60 seconds

All BigDecimal values always contain exactly two decimal places and use `HALF_ROUND_UP` rounding. eg: 10.345 is returned as 10.35, 10.8 is returned as 10.80

 

DELETE /transactions

This endpoint causes all existing transactions to be deleted

The endpoint should accept an empty request body and return a 204 status code.

 

Requirements

These are the additional requirements for the solution:

∙ You are free to choose any JVM language to complete the challenge in, but your application has to run in Maven or Gradle.

∙ The API has to be thread safe with concurrent requests.

∙ The POST /transactions and GET /statistics endpoints MUST execute in constant time and memory ie O(1). Scheduled cleanup is not sufficient

∙ The solution has to work without a database (this also applies to in-memory databases).

∙ Unit tests are mandatory.

∙ In addition to passing the tests, the solution must be at a quality level that you would be comfortable enough to put in production.
